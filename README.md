# Machine Learning Internship Projects – Elevvo Pathways

This repository contains four machine learning projects completed during my remote internship with **Elevvo Pathways**, a Cairo-based technical and vocational training company. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning including regression, clustering, classification, and deep learning.

These projects helped strengthen my understanding of end-to-end machine learning workflows — from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and visualization.

- Visualization of Predictions

### 2. Customer Segmentation
A clustering-based project to segment mall customers using their annual income and spending scores.

**Key Topics:**
- Data Scaling and Visualization
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method to find optimal clusters
- 2D Cluster Plotting

### 3. Loan Approval Prediction
A classification task to predict whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant details.

**Key Topics:**
- Handling Missing Data
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### 4. Traffic Sign Recognition
A deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify German traffic signs from images.

**Key Topics:**
- Image Preprocessing (Resizing, Normalization)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Multi-class Classification
- Evaluation using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix

📥 **Important:** Before running this project, please download the complete dataset containing traffic sign images from the following Kaggle link and extract it:
